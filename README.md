#Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This folder contains the following files:
* CodeBook.md - describes the input and output data and the transformations
* run_analysis.R - script performing the transformation.

To reproduce the transformation put the directory *UCR HAR Dataset* of the original data set under the working folder. 
Run the run_analysis() function defined in the script. The result of the processing are two new files stored in the working folder:
* X_test_and_train.txt
* X_mean_by_subject_activity.txt
